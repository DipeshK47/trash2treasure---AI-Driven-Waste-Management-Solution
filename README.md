# trash2treasure - Turning waste into rewards, one cleanup at a time

trash2treasure is an AI-powered waste management web application aimed at encouraging users to report, clean, and be rewarded for waste collection. The platform uses AI to verify the cleanup process by comparing before and after images of waste sites. Users can also track their contributions on a leaderboard, promoting a gamified and community-driven approach to cleaner environments.

## 🔋 Features

### 🌍 Report Waste
Users can contribute to a cleaner environment by reporting waste through the platform. The process begins by uploading an image of a waste site. Along with the photo, users submit the location and a brief description of the waste. This initiates a waste report, which is logged and viewable by the user for future reference. This feature encourages active reporting of environmental issues.

### 🧹 Upload Cleaned Image
After a waste site has been cleaned, users can upload a second image showing the cleaned area. The uploaded "after" image is compared to the "before" image using **Gemini AI**'s advanced image comparison algorithms. The system ensures that the cleanup is legitimate by verifying that the two images match the same location and show a clear improvement. This AI-driven verification process helps maintain the credibility and integrity of the platform.

### 🏆 Earn Rewards
Once the platform verifies the cleanup, users are rewarded for their contribution. The reward system is based on the size, type, and impact of the cleanup. Users can accumulate points for each verified cleanup, which can later be redeemed for various rewards, encouraging regular participation. The rewards are designed to motivate users to engage in continued environmental action.

### 📊 Leaderboard
The platform features a community leaderboard where users can see how they rank based on their contributions. Points earned through cleanups are tallied, and the leaderboard highlights top contributors. This gamification aspect not only adds a competitive element but also fosters a sense of community, as users can inspire each other to clean up more waste and make a greater impact.

### 🔒 Secure Image Verification
The core of the trash2treasure platform is its AI-powered image verification system. By using **Gemini AI**, the platform ensures that the uploaded "before" and "after" images are genuinely from the same location and reflect actual cleanup progress. The AI compares key features of both images to ensure accuracy and prevent fraudulent submissions. This security measure helps build trust in the system and guarantees that users are rewarded only for legitimate cleanups.

### 📱 Responsive Design
trash2treasure is built with a fully responsive design to ensure a seamless experience on any device, whether users are accessing it from a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone. The user interface adjusts dynamically to different screen sizes, ensuring that reporting waste, uploading images, and checking the leaderboard can be done effortlessly, no matter where users are.

## 🎯 Goal of the Project

trash2treasure aims to tackle waste management issues by empowering individuals to take action in their communities. By providing a user-friendly platform with AI-driven verification, rewards, and gamification, the project promotes an active approach to environmental conservation while ensuring transparency and fairness in recognizing user contributions.
